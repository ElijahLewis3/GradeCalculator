There are also restrictions in terms of passing the course.

~There is a plagiarism checker within the course called SOSS, if the plagiarism checker gets flagged for ALL 3 assignments the student receives an automatic zero in the course

~If an assignment gets flagged by SOSS, that assignment grade is now 0

~There is a choice if the student wants to transfer the weight of their Lab Exam to the Final Exam, if they select this option, the Lab Exam is now worth 0% and the Final Exam is worth 40%.
